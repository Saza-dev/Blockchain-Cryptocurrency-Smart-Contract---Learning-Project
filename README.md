# üîê Blockchain, Cryptocurrency & Smart Contract - Learning Project

This is a simple learning project where I built a basic blockchain, created a custom cryptocurrency, and developed a smart contract using Solidity. The aim is to understand how blockchain works, how cryptocurrencies are managed, and how to write and deploy Ethereum smart contracts.

The project includes a basic blockchain with transaction handling, proof-of-work, and mining. The cryptocurrency is implemented over the blockchain, simulating transfers and validation. A smart contract is also included, written in Solidity and tested with Remix and MetaMask.

Technologies used include Python/JavaScript for the blockchain, Solidity for smart contracts, and tools like Ganache, Hardhat, and Remix for testing and deployment.

This project is for educational purposes and is open to contributions or suggestions!
